Task version used in fMRI sample of Davidow et al 2016 Neuron.

For questions please contact jdavidow@fas.harvard.edu


This task was designed to stop at each break in between runs of fMRI.
The script “format_butterfly_learnDat.m” is meant to put the 4 runs back together into a single data file,
and this must also be done for the file that will run the memory test.
