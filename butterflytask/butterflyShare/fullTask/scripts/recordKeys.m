function [keys RT] = recordKeys(startTime,duration,deviceNumber,exitIfKey);

% Modified from collectKeys.
% Collects keypresses for a given duration.
% Duration is in seconds.
% If using OSX, you MUST provide a deviceNumber.
% If using Windows, you do not need to provide a deviceNumber -- if you do,
% it will be ignored.
% Optional argument exitIfKey: if exitIfKey==1, function returns after
% first keypress. 
%
% Example usage: do this if duration = length of event
%   [keys RT] = recordKeys(GetSecs,0.5,deviceNumber)
%
% Example usage: do this if duration = endEvent-trialStart
%   goTime = 0;
%   startTime = GetSecs;  % This is the time the trial starts
%   goTime = goTime + pictureTime;  % This is the duration from startTime to the end of the next event
%   Screen(Window,'Flip');
%   [keys RT] = recordKeys(startTime,goTime,deviceNumber);
%   goTime = goTime + blankTime;    % This is the duration from startTime to the end of the next event
%   Screen(Window,'Flip');
%   [keys RT] = recordKeys(startTime,goTime,deviceNumber);
%
% A note about the above example: it's best to calculate the duration from
% the beginning of each trial, rather than from the beginning of each
% event. Some commands may cause delays (like Flip), and if you calculate
% duration by event, these delays will accumulate. If you calculate
% duration from the beginning of the trial, your presentations may be a
% tiny bit truncated, but you'll be on schedule. It's your call.
% Even better: calculate duration from the beginning of the experiment.
%
% Using deviceNumber:
% KbCheck only collects from the first key input device found. On a laptop,
% this is usually the laptop keyboard. However, often you'll want to collect
% from another device, like the buttonbox in the scanner! You MUST specify
% the device number, or none of the input from the buttonbox will be
% collected. Device numbers change according to what order the USB devices
% were plugged in, and you may find that you can only perform this check
% ONCE using the command d=PsychHID('Devices'); so DO NOT change the device
% arrangement (which port each is plugged into) after performing the check.
% Restarting Matlab will allow you to use d=PsychHID('Devices') again
% successfully.
% On Windows, KbCheck records simultaneously from all keyboards -- you
% cannot specify.

% collectKeys:
% JC 02/16/2006 Wrote it.
% JC 02/28/2006 Added deviceNumber.
% JC 08/14/2006 Added break if time is up, even if key is being held down.
% recordKeys:
% JC 03/31/2007 Changed from etime to GetSecs. Added platform check. Added cell check.
% JC 07/02/2007 Added exitIfKey.
% JC 08/02/2007 Fixed "Don't start until keys are released" to check for
% duration exceeded
